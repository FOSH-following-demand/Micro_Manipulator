**1. Building the X axis plate:**

Mechanical parts:

- 23mm nylon wheels - 4 pieces               
- M5x30mm - 4 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut)   
- M3x25mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut)            

3D printed parts 
- 4 cylinders         
- Base of the X axis  
- Y axis support     

In the following figure, we can see all the needed parts:



First, we take one of the M5x30mm bolts and put it in a nylon wheel and adjust it with its corresponding nut

We take the printed cylinders and put it after the nut

Then, we insert this piece inside one of the wholes of the base of the X axis, and repeat for the 4 wheels and put them in the base of the X axis

We adjust it with his corresponding nut

we introduce the 2 profiles in the nuts that protrude from the plate

**2. Building the X axis:**

Mechanical parts:

- 6 aluminium profiles T-SLOT ( 2 of 25cm size and 4 of 30cm size)
- 1 NEMA 17 stepper motor 
- 1 belt of 50cm 
- 1 timing pulley 
- 4 angles for profiles 
- M3x10mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 
- M5x10mm - 8 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 
- M5x30mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 

In the following figure, we can see the mechanical pieces

3D printed parts:

- Motor support 
- Fit for belt 
- Right adjuster pulley and profile 
- Left adjuster pulley and profile 

In the following figure, we can see the 3D printed pieces:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2024..jpeg)

We begin by putting four 30cm-profiles in a row and two other profiles of 25 cm. underneath, we put the hammer nut at the profile located at the end as shown in the figure

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%202..jpeg)

We adjust the nut alongside the angle and one M5 bolt of 10 mm

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%203..jpeg)

We repeat the last step with another M5 bolt (10 mm) in the other side of the angle

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.4..jpeg)

Then, we put the 3D printed piece designed to give support to NEMA 17 motor in one of the M5 bolts (30 mm) located inside the profile

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%206..jpeg)

We adjust the piece with a M5 nut 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/FIG5.jpeg)

We use another bolt to readjust the piece with the profile  

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.7..jpeg)

We put the motor inside the piece and use the corresponding bolts to adjust it 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.8..jpeg)

We check that all the pieces are correctly aligned 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.9..jpeg)

Before adjusting the profiles of the other extreme, we insert the plate of the X axis 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.10..jpeg)

We repeat the steps of the adjustment of the angle with the profile and the M5 bolts 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.11..jpeg)

We make sure that both sides of the profile are aligned 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.12..jpeg)

If the bolt does not fit properly, a thin material can be inserted underneath to mae sure it fits properly 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.13.jpeg)

We verify that the four angles are correctly located

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.14..jpeg)

Then, we put the hammer nuts in the profiles in order to put the pieces that support the pulley 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.15..jpeg)

For this, the M5 bolts (10 mm)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.16..jpeg)

We put both pieces and align the profiles 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.17..jpeg)

We insert the pulley between the pieces and adjust with a M5 bolt and its corresponding nut 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2019.jpeg)

Introduce the belt in the printed adjusment piece and fizate it with a safety strap 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2020..jpeg)

Cut the remaining unused part of the remaining strap 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2021..jpeg)

Introduce the adjusment piece in the base of the X ais

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2022..jpeg)

Tae the other extrem of the belt and pass it underneath and in between the profiles in order to take it to the other extreme and introduce it at the other side of the X axis base. Use a safety strap to adjust it 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/FIG25.jpeg)

Check that the belt is correctly tensioned 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.23..jpeg)

Now, put the supporting piece of the Y axis 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2032..jpeg)

Make sure this piece fits over the M3 bolts an adjust them with their corresponding nuts 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Fig.%2033..jpeg)

Make sure the axis is completely stable
