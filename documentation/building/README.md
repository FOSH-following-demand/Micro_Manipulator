**1. Building the X axis plate:**

Mechanical parts:

- 23mm nylon wheels - 4 pieces               
- M5x30mm - 4 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut)   
- M3x25mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut)            

3D printed parts 
- 4 cylinders         
- Base of the X axis  
- Y axis support     

First, we take one of the M5x30mm bolts and put it in a nylon wheel and adjust it with its corresponding nut

**2. Building the X and Y axis:**

Mechanical parts:

- 6 aluminium profiles T-SLOT ( 2 of 25cm size and 4 of 30cm size)
- 1 NEMA 17 stepper motor 
- 1 belt of 50cm 
- 1 timing pulley 
- 4 angles for profiles 
- M3x10mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 
- M5x10mm - 8 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 
- M5x30mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 

3D printed parts:

- Motor support 
- Fit for belt 
- Right adjuster pulley and profile 
- Left adjuster pulley and profile 

We begin by putting one of the 30cm-profiles and put the hammer nut with one of the angles as shown in the figure


![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_05.jpg)

We adjust the nut alongside the angle and repeat the last step with other nut in the other extreme of the profiles and adjust with the corresponding bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_06.jpg)

Now we must align this piece with 2 profiles of 25cm and adjust them with bolts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_07.jpg)

we adjust with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_08.jpg)

we use a 3d printed profile separator and put the bolt with the hammer nut

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_09.jpg)

introduce this profile separator between the two profiles

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_10.jpg)

we turn the pieces and adjust with the bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_11.jpg)

Likewise, we repeat the steps for the other side of the profile

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_12.jpg)

Then, we enter the plate of the X axis previously assembled on the rail of profile X

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_13.jpg)

we will use now, the 3d printed left and right belt adjuster with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_14.jpg)

We put both in the 2 profiles, adjusting them with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_15.jpg)

then we enter the pulley and place it with the M5

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_16.jpg)

Now we go to the other side of the profiles and place the 3d printed motor support

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_17.jpg)

then we place the motor and adjust with its respective bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_18.jpg)

we put the pulley timing to the motor

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_19.jpg)

Now we place the timing belt and adjust on both sides with a cable tie

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_20.jpg)

now we turn the equipment and use a profile separator between the other two profiles to align the profiles 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_21.jpg)

adjust with the corresponding nut

as in previous steps we place the left and right belt adjuster with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_30.jpg)

then we enter the pulley and place it with the M5

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_31.jpg)

Then, we enter the plate of the Y axis previously assembled on the rail 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_32.jpg)

Now we go to the other side of the profiles and place the 3d printed motor support

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_33.jpg)

adjust with the corresponding nut

**4. Building the Z axis:**

we will use the lead screw with its mount, we adjust with its nut

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_39.jpg)

we introduce the 2 bolts to hold the piece
 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_40.jpg)

for this case we will use 6mm steel rods and linear rod bearing printed in 3D with this measure

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_41.jpg)

We introduce the rods to the linear rod bearing

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_41_0.jpg)

In the same way we have a piece printed in 3d to place a ball bearing

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42.jpg)

Place the pieces to fit on both sides of the rod

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_0.jpg)

how the complete structure would look

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_1.jpg)

we introduce all this structure in a support piece that constitutes the z-axis

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_2.jpg)

we place the motor on the shaft

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_3.jpg)

we enter an 8mm screw

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_4.jpg)

we put a shaft coupling to join the motor with the screw

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_5.jpg)

once we have all the complete piece we join everything to the Y axis plate and adjust the nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_42_6.jpg)

**5. Adapting the needle with the servo:**

We use the servo support and we adjust it to the part that is attached to the lead screw

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_44.jpg)

we enter the servo and adjust with their corresponding bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_44_0.jpg)

we put the servo arm and adjust

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_44_1.jpg)

we have a piece printed in 3D designed for hoses of 3mm, which we enter and join the needle (with its lid placed for security)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_44_2.jpg)

we join this piece with the servo arm adjusting with its screw
