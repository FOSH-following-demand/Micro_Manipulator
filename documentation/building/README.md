**1. Building the X axis plate:**

Mechanical parts:

- 23mm nylon wheels - 4 pieces               
- M5x30mm - 4 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut)   
- M3x25mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut)            

3D printed parts 
- 4 cylinders         
- Base of the X axis  
- Y axis support     

In the following figure, we can see all the needed parts:



First, we take one of the M5x30mm bolts and put it in a nylon wheel and adjust it with its corresponding nut

We take the printed cylinders and put it after the nut

Then, we insert this piece inside one of the wholes of the base of the X axis plate, and repeat for the 4 wheels

We adjust it with his corresponding nut

we introduce the 2 profiles in the nuts that protrude from the plate

we adjust the screws from the other side of the nylon wheels

**2. Building the X and Y axis:**

Mechanical parts:

- 6 aluminium profiles T-SLOT ( 2 of 25cm size and 4 of 30cm size)
- 1 NEMA 17 stepper motor 
- 1 belt of 50cm 
- 1 timing pulley 
- 4 angles for profiles 
- M3x10mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 
- M5x10mm - 8 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 
- M5x30mm - 2 pieces (Bolt and hammer nut) 

In the following figure, we can see the mechanical pieces 

3D printed parts:

- Motor support 
- Fit for belt 
- Right adjuster pulley and profile 
- Left adjuster pulley and profile 

In the following figure, we can see the 3D printed pieces:

We begin by putting one of the 30cm-profiles and put the hammer nut with one of the angles as shown in the figure


![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_05.jpg)

We adjust the nut alongside the angle and repeat the last step with other nut in the other extreme of the profiles and adjust with the corresponding bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_06.jpg)

Now we must align this piece with 2 profiles of 25cm and adjust them with bolts

we adjust with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_08.jpg)

we use a 3d printed profile separator and put the bolt with the hammer nut

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_09.jpg)

introduce this profile separator between the two profiles

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_10.jpg)

we turn the pieces and adjust with the bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_11.jpg)

Likewise, we repeat the steps for the other side of the profile

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_12.jpg)

Then, we enter the plate of the X axis previously assembled on the rail of profile X

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_13.jpg)

we will use now, the 3d printed left and right belt adjuster with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_14.jpg)

We put both in the 2 profiles, adjusting them with nuts

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_15.jpg)

then we enter the pulley and place it with the M5

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_16.jpg)

Now we go to the other side of the profiles and place the 3d printed motor support

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_17.jpg)

then we place the motor and adjust with its respective bolt

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_18.jpg)

we put the pulley timing to the engine

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_19.jpg)

Now we place the timing belt and adjust on both sides with a cable tie

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_20.jpg)

now we turn the equipment and use a profile separator between the other two profiles to align the profiles 


![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_21.jpg)

We insert the pulley between the pieces and adjust with a M5 bolt and its corresponding nut 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_21.jpg)

Introduce the belt in the printed adjusment piece and fizate it with a safety strap 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_22.jpg)

Cut the remaining unused part of the remaining strap

**3. Building the X axis plate:**

Take the M5x30mm bolts and put it in a nylon wheel and adjust it with its corresponding nut

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_24.jpg)

We take the printed cylinders and put it after the nut

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_25.jpg)

Then, we insert this piece inside one of the wholes of the base of the Y axis plate , and repeat for the 4 wheels 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_26.jpg)

Now, put the supporting piece of the Y axis 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_27.jpg)

Make sure this piece fits over the M3 bolts an adjust them with their corresponding nuts 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FOSH-following-demand/Micro_Manipulator/master/documentation/building/Figures/Fig_28.jpg)

Make sure the axis is completely stable
