## notes for the calls:

### Call on June 14th

Note taker: Andre

Hectic week, international travels, master thesis defense! So this project was left a bit to the side (understandably so!).
Still the team has made progress. and shared it during the call.

The prototype is complete! 
There is a problem with the stability of the Z axis, it vibrates when operated.

Suggestions: 
- build an U shaped part and put on top of Z axis,
- build triangularshapes and fix then to the side of the profile.

Another issue, there is soee wobble in the wheel/profile junction.  

Suggestions:
- use springs to keep the junction under tension.

For next week:
- Wednesday June 19Th
Step by step guide on documentation.

### Call on June 4th 

Note taker: Andre

Paypal transfer takes 5 working days, so the transfer will only be available tomorrow.
But they have been buying parts already.

Updates:

 - They assembled part of the axes. they were based on 3D printers and open bricks?. Some parts had to be adapted so the whole
 thing would fit inside the microscope. The main problem is the height. 


Struggles:
The height is an issue, since microscopes have a very high variation. 
the designs are built with Blender.
One idea is to use arrays in Blender so that people can easily change the size (they are predefined though).




What's next:
- put micro servo on the Z axis to engage the syringe. 
- from commercial manipulator: three wheels are used for each axis
- bill of materials and building instructions


- to calibrate: take a picture from each point and set that position on software. Go to another position and come 
back to the previous position to see how much error is there.
