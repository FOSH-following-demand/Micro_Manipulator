## notes for the calls:

Call on June 4th 
Note taker: Andre

Paypal transfer takes 5 working days, so the transfer will only be available tomorrow.
But they have been buying parts already.

Updates:

 - They assembled part of the axes. they were based on 3D printers and open bricks?. Some parts had to be adapted so the whole
 thing would fit inside the microscope. The main problem is the height. 


Struggles:
The height is an issue, since microscopes have a very high variation. 
the designs are built with Blender.
One idea is to use arrays in Blender so that people can easily change the size (they are predefined though).




What's next:
- put micro servo on the Z axis to engage the syringe. 
- from commercial manipulator: three wheels are used for each axis
- bill of materials and building instructions


- to calibrate: take a picture from each point and set that position on software. Go to another position and come 
back to the previous position to see how much error is there.
